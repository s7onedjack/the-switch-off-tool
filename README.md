If you own an amplifier with a built in countdown timer, then this article is not for you.

Useful tool for music lovers, who want to save their speakers after they have fallen asleep.

Do  you love music and want to listen some chill tunes from your computer before you fall asleep? I mean, listening via your sound system, not the ear-bud version or the built-in speakers of your laptop.
Well, it is possible - says Captain Obvious. But how can you do it without damaging your speakers, or external sound card?
You set up a countdown in your media player, what tells your computer when to turn off/hibernate/... At the moment your computer turns off and your sound system is still on , appears this short transient which makes the unwanted noise - this is what you want to avoid.

For that reason an idea popped out of my head; therefore  I need a tool, that can satisfy my needs, for instance with the use of an Arduino Uno.
